Typing Extensions -- Backported and Experimental Type Hints for Python

The ``typing`` module was added to the standard library in Python 3.5, but
many new features have been added to the module since then.
This means users of Python 3.5 - 3.6 who are unable to upgrade will not be
able to take advantage of new types added to the ``typing`` module, such as
``typing.Protocol`` or ``typing.TypedDict``.

The ``typing_extensions`` module contains backports of these changes.
Experimental types that will eventually be added to the ``typing``
module are also included in ``typing_extensions``, such as
``typing.ParamSpec`` and ``typing.TypeGuard``.

Users of Python versions before 3.5 should install and use
the ``typing`` module from PyPI instead of using this one, unless specifically
writing code that must be compatible with multiple Python versions or requires
experimental types.
